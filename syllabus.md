## Course Description

Cooperative games are games where players work together, communicate through signals, and establish conventions to achieve collective goals. 

In this course, we will play and analyze the strategy of various cooperative games, particularly those with deep, open-ended underlying strategies, such as Hat Guessing Games, Contract Bridge, and, most extensively, Hanabi.

The majority of class time will be dedicated to playing cooperative games, though we will also have brief lectures and group discussions. As such, attendance is mandatory as in-class participation is the primary way you will engage with course material. We will have occasional labs outside of class, and encourage you all to continue playing cooperative games outside of class.

Familiarity with Python (at a CS61A/CS88 level) is highly recommended. This is mostly for the Hanabi lab, which will be a short implementation of a few strategies in code. That said, if you don’t have prior programming experience, let us know and we can work something out! 


## Enrollment information

If you are interested in joining the Cooperative Games DeCal, please fill out the Google Form application below. CCN's and Permission Numbers will be given out on the first day of class. 

The application is due on January 28, 2022. We hope to release acceptances by the end of the day on January 29th, and all accepted students are invited to come to our first class on Monday, January 31st!


Course Policies:
- **Attendance and Timeliness**: We will be taking attendance at the beginning of every class. If a student has more than 3 unexcused absences will result in an NP in the course. Classes will begin at Berkeley time. Arriving late 3 times will count as an absence. If you will be missing a class, let us know 24 hours in advance. 
- **Accommodations**: If you need special accommodations for the class, please let us know as soon as possible so we can make the class an optimal learning environment for everyone. 
- **Extensions**: If you miss an assessment, we will work with you to schedule an alternate assessment only if you reach out beforehand with a reason of sufficient cause. 
- **In Person**: The expectation is that all students attend in person. We won’t be offering a remote counterpart for a couple reasons. First, many cooperative games we are considering don’t have remote versions, or the remote versions are inconsistent. Second, since these games are cooperative, the class relies on active engagement, and that’s best achieved in person.   

## Grading

We will compute grades from a weighted average, as follows:
- Labs: 15%
- Attendance: 25%
- Participation: 50%
- Hanabi Evaluation: 10%
