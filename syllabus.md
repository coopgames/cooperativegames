## Course Description

Cooperative games are games where players work together, communicate through signals, and establish conventions to achieve collective goals. 

In this course, we will play and analyze the strategy of various cooperative games, particularly those with deep, open-ended underlying strategies, such as Hat Guessing Games, Contract Bridge, and, most extensively, Hanabi.

The majority of class time will be dedicated to playing cooperative games, though we will also have brief lectures and group discussions. As such, attendance is mandatory as in-class participation is the primary way you will engage with course material. We will have two projects outside of class, and encourage you all to continue playing cooperative games outside of class.

Familiarity with Python (at a CS61A/CS88 level) is highly recommended. This is mostly for the Hanabi Project, which will be a short implementation of a few strategies in code. That said, if you don’t have prior programming experience, let us know and we can work something out! 


## Course Policies:

- **Attendance**: Classes will begin at Berkeley time. If you will be missing a class, let us know 24 hours in advance. We will be taking attendance at the beginning of every class. 
- **Absences**: We have the following absence policy:
    - No unexcused absences. If a student has *any* unexcused absences, it will result in an NP in the course. 
    - One excused absence.
        - Sickness, Family Emergencies, etc
    - One “life is busy” absence.
        - This is a DeCal, and we know things get busy at times, so everyone gets one “life is busy” absence. 
        - Note that this is a team based class, so missing class can hurt your team chemistry (most specifically during the hanabi unit).

- **Accommodations**: If you need special accommodations for the class, please let us know as soon as possible so we can make the class an optimal learning environment for everyone. 
- **Extensions**: If you miss an assessment, we will work with you to schedule an alternate assessment only if you reach out beforehand with a reason of sufficient cause. 
- **In Person**: The expectation is that all students attend in person. We won’t be offering a remote counterpart for a couple reasons. Since these games are cooperative, the class relies on active engagement, and that’s best achieved in person.   

## Grading

We will compute grades from a weighted average, as follows:
- Projects: 25%
    - We are planning on having two projects in the class. The first will be implementing some actions of Hanabi in code, and it will be worth 10% of your total grade, or 40% of your project grade. The second is an open ended, final cooperative game project, and it will be worth 15% of your total grade, or 60% of your project grade. Some ideas for this include creating a new cooperative game, formalizing the strategy for an existing game, etc. More details on both of the above will be sent later in the class.
- Participation: 60%
    - As long as you come to class, listen, and play the games, you will get these points!
- Hanabi Evaluation: 15%
    - At the end of the Hanabi unit, we will have an evaluation. Simply put, you will play the game three times, and your score on the assignment is your best of the three runs. The assignment will be out of 25 points.
